# INote: Note-Taking Application
This Java-based Note-Taking Application allows users to create, save, view, and manage simple text notes through a graphical interface. The application organizes notes in a dedicated folder and provides a convenient way to access them directly from the GUI.

## Features
Create and Save Notes: Users can create new notes in separate tabs, enter text, and save notes directly to the filesystem.
View Saved Notes: A file directory panel lists all saved notes, allowing users to easily open and view any saved note.
Tabbed Interface: Each note opens in a new tab, allowing multiple notes to be viewed or edited simultaneously.
Simple File System Organization: Notes are stored as individual files in a designated directory.
